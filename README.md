## MATLAB version and toolboxes required

- MATLAB R2023a or above.
- Parallel Computing Toolbox, Communications Toolbox, and Phased Array System Toolbox.

## Main characteristics

- Link-level performance evaluation and analysis for THz MIMO ISAC based on TDD framework.
- Terahertz peculiarity modeling.
- Standard OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM waveforms.
- Range-velocity-angle estimation and localization with virtual MIMO array technique.
- Sensing-aided downlink communication with spatial multiplexing.
- A user interface with elaborate parameter configuration.

## How to get started

- Simply click and run THz_MIMO_ISAC_Simulator.mlapp,
- Configure the required parameters on the user interface and click 'Run Simulation',
- Wait for the simulation to complete and pop up a successful run message box, then click the 'Plot' and 'Show Numerical Results' buttons to view the simulation results.

## Notes

- 32 GB RAM or above is recommended for the simulation of large number of subcarriers, symbols and antennas.
- Before running the simulation, it is recommended to load parallel operations via the command of 'parpool('Processes');' for faster computation of terahertz molecular absorption coefficient.
- The logical connection between the user interface and the main functions (THz_MIMO_OFDM_Sen.p and THz_MIMO_OFDM_Com.p) can be checked in the 'Design View' and 'Code View' of file THz_MIMO_ISAC_Simulator.mlapp, and users can modify the details.
- When inappropriate parameters are set, the simulator will force a stop and present an error warning via both message box and command line window.

## Version history

- v1.0: Initial version and demo for GitHub release and paper publication, and still under developing and debugging.
